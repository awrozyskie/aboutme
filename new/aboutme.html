  <h1 class="">About Me</h1>
  <p>I am a graduating Senior from the Virginia Military Institute. This experence has turned me into a dedicated, hardworking person who loves working in group settings and also by myself. People often have described me as a driven, friendly and helpful
    person. My motto is always have a smile on your face, a song in your heart, and a willingness to work and you can get anything accomplished.

  <h1>Things Important to Me</h1>
  <p><b>Civic engagement</b> and <b>community</b> are some of the most important things to me. I feel that if you are going to belong to a society or a community then you need to participate. I have written many articles on the matter and am a strong activist
    for Civic engagement. Civic engagement changes the landscape of communities and one of the ways you can do that is online.</p>

  <br />
  <h2>What are your favorite hobbies?</h2>
  <p>While technology reading and writing are my true loves of mine, everybody needs a mind clearing break. Over the past four years I have been an instructor teaching incoming freshman the Virginia Military Institute how to build team unity through overcoming
    both high and low initiative obstacles. In addition to this, I have also been working in the Writing Center as Manager of the Cadet E-portfolio team. In this hobby I help lead a team of seven tutors and we develop troubleshooting guides for cadets
    to use our campus WordPress program. I also enjoy the outdoors. I am a big fishing buff and rather enjoy <b>hiking, kayaking, and even climbing</b>. Chances are if it is outdoors I’m in.</p>

  <h2>What's your dream job?</h2>
  <p>My dream job is to work as a web developer for a business creating interactive websites that promote products and events, and can act as way for the company to interact with its customers. I would love to this for startup companies because I believe
    that communities are essential to local growth and development.</p>

  <h2>What music have you been listening to lately?</h2>
  <p>Music is one of those subjects that I don’t understand how anyone could hate. I love most types of music but here recently I have been listening to Milky Chance. I first heard them when I was studying abroad and ever since then I have loved their music</p>
